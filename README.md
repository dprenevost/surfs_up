This alalysis is being conducted as part of a buisiness viability evaluation for a surf \icecream shop on the island of Oahu.  More specificaly the rainfall and          temperaturesduring peak tourism times.
The code from this project will be saved so we do not have to duplicate efforts when or if we decide to expand our buisiness to other islands in Hawaii.

## Overview of the statistical analysis:
     This is a representation of the amount of rainfall in Oahu using 9 different weather stations covering the entire previous year from 8/23/2016 to 8/23/2017.
